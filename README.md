# 👋 Welcome Program in Python

## 📋 Description
This is a basic Python program that prompts the user to enter their **first name** and **last name**, then combines them and displays a personalized greeting message.

## 🧾 How It Works
1. The program asks the user to input their **first name**.
2. Then, it asks for the **last name**.
3. It combines both names into a full name.
4. Finally, it prints a greeting message using the full name.

## 🧑‍💻 Code Example
```python
FN = input("Enter the First name : ")
LN = input("Enter the Second name: ")
FLN = FN + " " + LN
print("Hello " + FLN + "! Welcome to python program")
